NAME
       nldiff - Applies a Nodediff file to a given Nodelist

SYNOPSIS
       nldiff [-d] [-n] /path/to/nodelist /path/to/nodediff

DESCRIPTION
       nldiff applies a Nodediff file to a given Nodelist.  It has no intelli-
       gence as to determining which of multiple Nodediff files is the correct
       one (you have to use other tools for this), but it expects the Nodelist
       filename and the Nodediff filename as explicit arguments with the  cor-
       rect day file name extension.

       This  manual  page  was  written  for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
       because the original program does not have a manual page  (but  a  good
       README).

OPTIONS
       [-d] Delete the Nodediff after the process succeeds.
       [-n] Delete the old Nodelist after the process succeeds.
       /path/to/nodelist The Nodelist to patch.
       /path/to/nodediff The Nodediff to be used.

EXAMPLES
       nldiff NODELIST.260 NODEDIFF.267
       Builds NODELIST.267 from NODELIST.260 and NODEDIFF.267

       nldiff -d -n NODELIST.260 NODEDIFF.267
       Same  as  above,  but  will  delete old Nodelist and the Nodediff after
       process succeeds.
