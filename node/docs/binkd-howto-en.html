<h2 class="chapter">1 How Can BinkD Work via HTTP-proxy?</h2>

<p>It is not a rare case when users go out to the internet from their
corporate LAN exclusively via the proxy server based at the only computer
connected to the internet. Thus BinkD cannot make a direct connection to
the remote node and one must use the proxy server.  Proxy servers support
was included in versions 0.9.3.https, 0.9.4 and the later ones.

   <p>One can use BinkD via a HTTP proxy only if CONNECT host 24554 command is
allowed in the proxy server or the CONNECT command is allowed for all
remote ports.  The command is usually used for the secure HTTP protocol (URLs
of the "HTTPS://..." type), it is also known as S-HTTP. Because of that
such a proxy is quite often referred as a HTTPS proxy.

   <p>If BinkD reports of an authorization error then the necessary command is
prohibited in the proxy configuration or it is allowed for the port 443
only (that is inessential for us).

   <p>Suppose the connected to the Internet computer has the IP address
192.168.0.1 in its LAN and the proxy server at the computer responds on
port 3128. Here is the line in BinkD configuration file necessary for
working via the HTTP proxy.

   <p>1. A proxy server without user authorization (no login and password are
demanded):

<pre class="example">         proxy 192.168.0.1:3128
</pre>
   <p>2. A proxy server with user authorization (it is necessary to type login
and password, e.g. login "user", password "password"):

<pre class="example">         proxy 192.168.0.1:3128/user/password
</pre>
   <p>3. Microsoft proxy server with NTLM protocol of user authorization (one
must be inside a domain).  Suppose login is "user", password is "password",
the user computer is "host" and the domain name is "ntdomain":

<pre class="example">         proxy 192.168.0.1:3128/user/password/host/ntdomain
</pre>
   <p>If the proxy server administrator has allowed connection only to some
selected ports (usually to port 443) then BinkD reports "Connection
rejected by proxy". Here is an example:

<pre class="verbatim">      31 Mar 16:48:43 [59987] BEGIN, binkd/0.9.3/SOCKS/HTTPS -p BINKD.CFG
      31 Mar 16:48:43 [59987] clientmgr started
    + 31 Mar 16:48:43 [40423] call to 2:5000/44@fidonet
      31 Mar 16:48:43 [40423] trying 195.209.235.3, port 24554...
      31 Mar 16:48:43 [40423] connected to proxy.osu.ru:24554
      31 Mar 16:48:44 [40423] Connection rejected by proxy (HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden)
    ? 31 Mar 16:48:44 [40423] unable to connect: {13} Permission denied
</pre>

   <p>In such a case you may try to use http tunnelling for instance with the
help of httport (one can take it at http://www.htthost.com/).

<h2 class="chapter">2 How Can BinkD Work via SOCKS-proxy?</h2>

<p>It is not a rare case when users go out to the internet from their
corporate LAN exclusively via the proxy server based at the only computer
connected to the internet. Thus BinkD cannot make a direct connection to
the remote node and one must use the proxy server. Proxy servers support
was included in version 0.9.4 and the later ones.

   <p>BinkD works with a SOCKS proxy version 4 and 5. The first one does not
demand an authorization (no login and password), the second one demands it
as a rule.

   <p>Suppose the connected to the Internet computer has the IP address
192.168.0.1 in its LAN and the SOCKS server at the computer responds on
port 1080. Here is the line in BinkD configuration file necessary for
working via the SOCKS proxy.

   <p>1. A SOCKS server without user authorization (no login and password are
demanded):

<pre class="example">         socks 192.168.0.1:1080
</pre>
   <p>2. A proxy server with user authorization (it is necessary to type login
and password, e.g. login "user", password "password"):

<pre class="example">         socks 192.168.0.1:1080/user/password
</pre>
   <p>If the proxy server administrator has allowed connection only to some
selected ports (usually to port 443) then BinkD reports "Connection
rejected by proxy". See example in a chapter See <a href="#g_t01">01</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">3 How Can I Add BinkD To a Fidonet Box Working With a Modem?</h2>

<p>1. You must configure your modem mailer and tosser for BSO (binkley-style
outbound) mode so that all of them including BinkD would have the same
inbound directories (and also the same outbound directories). If your
mailer can work with AMA (arcmail-attach) only you have to change your
mailer.

   <p>(This part don't translated, sorry.)
