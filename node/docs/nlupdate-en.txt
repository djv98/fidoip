NAME
       nlupdate - Manages your Nodelists and keeps them up to date.

SYNOPSIS
       nlupdate

DESCRIPTION
       nlupdate  manages  your  nodelists  and keeps them up to date. For each
       nodelist that you have configured with a "Nodelist" statement, it  will
       search the latest nodelist in the "NodelistDir", then caluclate the day
       number of the difference file that is needed to  update  this  nodelist
       (the  algorithm  is  Y2K safe and knows that 2000 is a leap year), then
       searches the difference file, unpacks it if necessary, and  applies  it
       to  the  nodelist using nldiff. nlupdate can also find full replacement
       files if you configure this, and just unpack them and  copy  them  over
       the old nodelist. This is usefule for othernets that do not have noded-
       iff files.  - With only a few  keywords,  nlupdate  manages  the  whole
       process of updating your nodelist files for you.


       This  manual  page  was  written  for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
       because the original program does not have a manual page  (but  a  nice
       README).
